# AdmissionPrediction

The current Project is developed to get an insight into how the score achieved in differnet disciplines effects the admission probability percentage of a student. The current Notebook is developed by using dataset from Kaggle to build a model to predict the percentage of student able to get admission given the past scores achieved by the candidate.

The given notebook has trained the model on only few kbs of dataset. The model has more potential to accelerate.
